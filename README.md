# PetClinic
My version of Spring MVC project Pet Clinic.  
PetClinic demonstrates the use of Spring Boot with Spring MVC and Spring Data.

### Project history
The PetClinic WebApp has an old and varied history dating right back to the beginning of the Spring Framework. It started life as a demonstration of nearly all the common things that you could do with Spring, back when it was possible to conceive of such a demonstration. These days it is a very small slice of what you could achieve, but the community has a soft spot for it, so it's nice to see it still going after all this time, so we hope you enjoy it too.
